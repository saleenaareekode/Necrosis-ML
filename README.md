# Necrosis-ML
Necrosis-ML is a segmentation and quantization tool based on deep learning and image-processing algorithms to quantify the amount of necrosis tissues present in a digital histopathology image. It is used to grade the cancer patients based on the amount of necrotic tissues present in the specimen. This quantity can be used as a measure to identify how severe the disease is and what treatment plan can be given to that patient. Different semantic segmentation methods have been used in this study, transformer based, auto-encoder based and transfer learning based etc. This research contributes a real dataset of 900 patches along with its labels that can be used in further research in this area.
